WEEK 1
===========================================================================

Group formation, created Jira account, still waiting on GitHub to be activated. Set up some Epics in Jira.

Organised Teams meeting for 19th Sept to discuss project objectives, user stories, and tech stack/system architecture.

Meeting: decided on 8 core/novel objectives, distributed research/investigation workloads.

Initialised backlog creation and refinement process (Rittisak wrote initial user stories), writing of some Acceptance Criteria.

===========================================================================
WEEK 2
===========================================================================

Created epics for each objective, split objectives into User Stories.

Set up slack channel with Teams and Jira integrations.

Meeting 1: consensus on objectives, distributed workload for Proposal.

Rittisak and I refined all the user stories and wrote the acceptance criteriaWe updated the project objectives accordingly
We discussed options for frontend design and structure, and decided on our approach.

Technical obstacle: Design and Storyboard
While we initially wanted to go with a Balsamiq/Figma combo, Figma-only seemed to be a much better/ hi res option for wireframing, as it also provided a real life example for frontend devs to work on.
I drafted up colour palette, font, and Figma designs; chose the project name and logo design. 
Held a 1-hr design meeting with Gunjan to figure out the page flow.
I continued design of pages in Figma, completing design of Landing, Login/Register, Home, Portfolio, Stock Page and other minor functionailites. I created an SVG image for the StockZen logo.

I updated all sprint dates on Jira and reviewed all project objectives and made adjustments to user stories

Meeting 2: Gunjan presented backend and AlphaVantage API, Jeehyun talked about system design, Rittisak and I talked about front end design. 

Meeting 3: Separate meeting with Badri to catch up on designs and wireframes.

Planned work: All proposal tasks, Devops setup
Achieved: All mostly achieved, with some work redistribution to accommodate some members.

Rittisak and I had a discussion around IDE tooling and git practises. I updated the formatting settings and include more instructions in the README.
