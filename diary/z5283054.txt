Week 1

# Planned:      I planned to form a group in week 1.
# Finished:     I formed a group with Khai, Gunjan, Badrivishal, Jeehyun. We decided
                to work on stock portfolio management system. We appointed Khai to be
                our Scruum master.
# Issue:        -
# Unfinished:   -
# Next:         We will devide out work on the proposal.

I registered my Atlassian account, linked my GitHub account. I posted in the Team forum
that I was seeking for a team.

We formed a team in week 1 lab session. We decided to work on the stock portfolio
project and we scheduled our next meeting to be 19 Sunday on what to do in the proposal.
We appointed Khai as our team Scruum master as he has some experience on the method.

============================================
Week 2

# Planned:      Finalise the user stories. Start working on the proposal.
# Finished:     We have came up with 2 novelties functionalities and almost finalised the
                user stories.
# Issue:        -
# Unfinished:   Setting up the GitHub as the GitHub classroom link is not provided yet.
# Next:         I and Khai will discuss about the dev environment, tools to use.

I worked with Khai to finalise the objectives and user stories. We also decided to use
Slack as a communication tool and Team as a meeting platform.

In the lab session, we ask some questions about the objective. After that we talk about
how to implement the project.

For the proposal, I and Khai were working on the objectives/user stories part. Jeehyun
was working on the Use case and Artitechture diagram. Badri was working on the design
and wireframe. Gunjan was working on the backgroud.

Khai also supplied us with design of screens on Figma. The url is

Week 3

# Planned:      We planned to finish and submit the proposal this week.
# Finished:     We submitted out proposal this week. I and Khai setup the dev 
                environement/communication channels.
# Issue:        Gunjan, Jeehyun, Badrivishal encountered an issue while setting up
                their backend environment. We also found that there is too many PR
                if we create it for all subtask so we are finding the better solution
                for this.
# Unfinished:   -
# Next:         We have assigned each member tasks in Jira. We will think of a way
                to solve the AlphaVantage API rate limie. We might write a script
                to query data from AlphaVantage and then cache the data in our database.

On Sunday, we had a stand-up meeting which we told what have we done, what will we do
and what's blocking us. Later that day I worked with Khai to assign a story point in
all storis.

I started implement the UI part including registration, login, logout. I and Khai worked
together to setup the environment for development and for a smoothe experience. 

We agreed to use pull request to review code before merge changes into main branch.

We agree to finalise the proposal on Thurday, I took a look a gave some comments.

I finished implement the UI of the user registration page along with the user registration
success page. I customised the colors in Bootstrap to match out selected colors
(https://coolors.co/0b132b-1c2541-3a506b-5bc0be-c2fff6).

I have a discussion with Khai that we have to find a way to query data from AlphaVantage
because there are limits on how many requests could be made in a period of time.

After I finished some of the task, I requested a pull request to Jeehyun and Khai.
The easy one I requested a review from Jeehyun and the complex one I requested a review
from Khai.

We had assign each member a user story to officially start our development process. I
chose to work on the user registration story. Khai chose a responsive design story.
Jeehyun chose the user login story. Gunjan chose the portfolio creation story. And
Badrivishal chose portfolio rename/delete story.

As there are so many tools used, I encountered a problem of too many tools to keep track.
I will find a way to reduce the problem.

Week 4

# Planned:      Implement the portfolio list, top performance widget.
# Finished:     The portfolio list is implemented along with the rename/delete functionalities.
                The stock search functionality is implemented using the cached listings (I'm 
                awaiting for the endpoint.)
# Issue:        The backend doesn't have endpoint to retrieve the data, rename the portfolio, or
                delete it yet. Pretty much every endpoint is not developed or merged into the main
                branch.
# Unfinished:   Data persistant in the data base as there are no endpoints for that yet.
# Next:         Wire up the frontend to the backend.

On Sunday, I implemented the layout of the portfolio list (using dummy data as backend hasn't
the endpoint yet.).

On Wednesday, I implemented the funcitonalities of rename/delete of a portfolio.

On Thurday, I reviewed the pull request from Jeehyun. She implemented the login page.

On Friday, I implemented the stock searching functionality. I use a listing from a cached listing
due to there is no endpoint available for me yet.

Week 5

# Planned:      To finish wire up the Frontend to call Backend's endpoints.
# Finished:     I took some of Khai's task (Portfolio Page) so that he could work on the backend.
# Issue:        A lot of endpoints are not finished and bakcend is almost has no data on the stock.
                I had an assessment from another course this week so I have to take a time off from
                the project. I had done almost all of my tasks so it should be okay.
# Unfinished:   The search widget as the backend endpoint is not available at all.
# Next:         We prepared for the demo so a lot of unfinished works are frozen for it.


Due to assessment from another course, I asked for a week-off. I think it's fair because I delivered
a lot of work in the first sprint (registration page, portfolio list, portfolio rename, portfolio delete,
portfolio page, top performer widget, stock search, stock add). I think I fall behind the term of
progress in another course.

This week I intended to use it to wire up the frontend to the backend. I finished wire up some of it
due to most of the endpoints are not available/not finished.

This week I mostly do a minor fix to my code.

Gunjan did some work on loading the stock data but there is no endpoint for the frontend yet.

Khai did a wonderful presentation in the demo this week.

Personally I think Jeehyun, Badrivishal, Gunjan worked a bit too slow. Almost no progress during
the week. And all of them never consult me on anything but they might talk with each other so
I'm not sure. Gunjan and Badrivishal did a lot of research on the stock API but there is almost
no data available to do the work. Jeehyun finished do a login/logout page, a portfolio creation page.
I think I have to tell them that I intend to do peer review according to their contribution. I
might give them a low score if their contribution is low or incomplete.

Week 6

# Planned:      Implement the sorting of portfolio list/portfolio page
# Finished:     Fix a bug in the top performer widget. Implement the Add/remove/edit of the lots.
                (This doesn't include API calling as the endpoints are not available yet.) Wire up
                the search to use API. I setup the GitHub workflow to make it run frontend tests.
# Issue:        The searhc API didn't return the market value.
# Unfinished:   Wire up the UI to the endpoints as the endpoints are not available.
# Next:         Implement the search functionality and wire up some of the endpoint.

I implemented the drag/drop and the temporary sort functionality of the portfolio page.
We did the retrospective this week.

I set up the test script to make GitHub run tests for frontend part and Khai set up the script
for backend part.

Jeehyun was working on the Stock page. She finished layouting the page (no data shown yet).

You should also include in this diary the following information (if applicable) about the
project progress:
- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry
- what was finished
- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not
endangered
- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
We expect that other members of the team may access this file to know where others are
up to, but you should not modify your peer’s work diary.
